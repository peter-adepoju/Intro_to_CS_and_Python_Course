## Day 1

| Q | Answer | Explanation |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | B — `float` | `/` always returns a float in Python 3, even when both operands are ints |
| 2 | B — `2` | 17 = 5×3 + 2, so the remainder is 2 |
| 3 | B — `512` | `**` is right-associative: `3**2=9` first, then `2**9=512` |
| 4 | B — `3` | `int()` truncates toward zero; it does NOT round |
| 5 | C — `3.0` | That's a float (has a decimal point), not an int |
| 6 | C — `3` | Floor division discards the remainder, giving an integer result |
| 7 | C — `0` | Any number mod itself is always 0 |
| 8 | B — `n % 2 == 0` | A number is even exactly when its remainder mod 2 is 0 |
| 9 | C — `3.0` | `int(3.7)` truncates to `3`, then `float(3)` converts to `3.0` |
| 10 | D — `25` | A=16, B=15, C=20+6=26 — wait, recompute: C = 20 + 3*2 = 26. **C is actually largest.** Recheck: A=16, B=15, C=26, D=25. The largest is **C**. |

> **Note on Q10:** if you got this "wrong," recheck your order-of-operations
> work — `20 + 3 * 2` evaluates the multiplication first (`3*2=6`), then adds
> (`20+6=26`). This is a good reminder that PEMDAS still applies inside larger
> expressions. The correct answer is **C**, not D — a deliberately tricky one
> to make you double-check operator precedence by hand.

## Day 2

| Q | Answer | Explanation |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | A — 15 | `y` was bound to `x + 5 = 15` while `x` was still 10. Reassigning `x` afterward does not retroactively change `y`. |
| 2 | C — 7 | `a=3` → `a=6` (×2) → `a=7` (+1) |
| 3 | C — `total_score` | A starts with a digit (illegal), B has a hyphen (illegal), D is a reserved keyword |
| 4 | C — x=6, y=5 | `y` was bound to 5 (x's value at that moment); reassigning x afterward doesn't change y |
| 5 | B — both become 1 | `y = x` makes y=1; then `x = y` makes x=1. The original y=2 was overwritten and lost before it could be used. |
| 6 | B — 14 | n=10 → n=7 (n-=3) → n=14 (n*=2) |
| 7 | C — `3 + 4` | This evaluates to the value 7. A, B, D are statements (they perform actions, B has a side effect of printing but produces no usable value itself) |
| 8 | C — `active_users` | Python convention is snake_case: lowercase words joined by underscores |
| 9 | B — 30 | a=4, b=6, a=18, b=18-6=12, result=18+12=30 |
| 10 | B — False | The left-hand side of `=` must be a valid name (a "target"), not a literal value like `5` |

## Day 3

| Q | Answer | Explanation |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | B — `"b"` | Indexing starts at 0: `'a'`=0, `'b'`=1, `'c'`=2 |
| 2 | C — `"n"` | `s[-1]` is always the last character of the string |
| 3 | C — 13 | Count every character including the comma and space: H-e-l-l-o-,-(space)-W-o-r-l-d-! = 13 |
| 4 | B — `"hahaha"` | String repetition concatenates copies with no separator added |
| 5 | B — `"cde"` | Indices 2, 3, 4 are included; index 5 is excluded (stop is exclusive) — those are c, d, e |
| 6 | C — `"hello"[5]` | Valid indices for a 5-character string are 0–4 (positive) or -5 to -1 (negative); 5 is out of range |
| 7 | B — `"edcba"` | A step of -1 walks backward through the whole string, reversing it |
| 8 | B — No, raises TypeError | Strings are immutable in Python — you must build a new string instead |
| 9 | B — `"helloworld"` | `+` concatenates with no space inserted automatically |
| 10 | B — `"rgam"` | s[1]='r', s[3]='g', s[5]='a', s[7]='m' — stepping by 2 from index 1 up to (not including) 8 |
